# I. word2vecVN
Word2Vec models for Vietnamese
## Download models:
- Model trained on Vietnamese Wiki: [click here](https://thiaisotajppub.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/publicfiles/wiki.vi.model.bin.gz).
- Model trained on Le et al.'s data (window-size 5, 400 dims): [click here](https://thiaisotajppub.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/publicfiles/baomoi.model.bin).
- Model trained on Le et al.'s data (window-size 2, 300 dims): [click here](https://thiaisotajppub.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/publicfiles/baomoi.window2.vn.model.bin.gz).
## Visualization:
- word2vec-visualization (using TensorBoard):
	+ Download tf\_files: [TBA](tba)
	+ Run $ tensorboard --log_dir=./<path-to-the-folder> --port=10001
- word2vec-simple-visualization: It is working well. Please read the readme file inside that folder to know how to test the model.
## Note: 
-  This model is trained using data of Le et al. http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/phuonglh/node/72
	+ Data information: 7.1G text with 1,675,819 unique words from a corpus of 974,393,244 raw words and 97,440 documents. Note that all words are tokenized words.
